## 📌 Executive Summary & Problem Solved

### The Problem
Freelancers, gig workers, and remote contractors lose millions of dollars and thousands of uncompensated work hours every year to increasingly sophisticated scams. Because freelancers operate without corporate HR departments, legal teams, or escrow safety nets, they are primary targets for:
* **Fake Check & Equipment Purchase Schemes:** Clients sending fraudulent checks or wire transfers asking freelancers to buy equipment from "approved vendors."
* **Off-Platform Migration Traps:** Clients forcing freelancers off protected platforms (Upwork, Fiverr) to Telegram or WhatsApp before a contract is established.
* **Unpaid Spec Work Exploitation:** Clients requesting completed 20-page "tests" or free custom designs under the guise of an evaluation.
* **Identity Theft & Phishing:** Unscreened clients demanding Social Security Numbers, passports, or banking logins before hiring.
* **Predatory Contracts:** Contracts hiding infinite revision clauses, non-competes, and strict liability terms.

### The Solution
**ShieldLance** is an end-to-end AI-powered fraud investigator and contract safety consultant designed specifically for freelancers. By leveraging **Gemini 3.6 Flash multimodal vision and structured analysis**, ShieldLance evaluates job postings, client email threads, PDF contracts, and messaging screenshots in seconds. It provides an objective 0–100 risk score, identifies granular red flags, drafts protective boundary-setting replies, and suggests probing questions to test client legitimacy.

## 🤖 The AI Feature & System Prompt Architecture

### What the AI Feature Does
ShieldLance uses **Gemini 3.6 Flash** through a dedicated Express server API proxy (`/api/analyze`). The backend uses `@google/genai` to perform multimodal text and image reasoning against structured JSON schemas, ensuring 100% type-safe JSON output parsing without hallucinatory formatting issues.

### System Instructions & System Prompt Behind the AI
The AI investigator is governed by the following system prompt executed on every scan:

```text
You are an expert Freelance & Remote Work Scam Investigator and Legal/Contract Safety Specialist.
Your task is to analyze freelance job postings, client messages, payment requests, contract clauses, or platform URLs for potential scams, fraud patterns, and exploitation.

Analyze the input thoroughly looking for red flags such as:
1. Fake Check / Equipment Purchase scams (asking freelancer to deposit check & buy equipment from "approved vendors").
2. Off-platform migration traps (insisting on moving from Upwork/Fiverr to Telegram, WhatsApp, Google Chat immediately before hire).
3. Security deposit / Application fee / ID verification fee scams.
4. Unpaid test tasks or massive spec work demands (asking for free finished work).
5. Unrealistic hourly rate vs skills ratio (e.g., $60/hr for simple data entry / retyping PDF).
6. Crypto / Wire Transfer / Zelle / Cash App payment insistences without escrow protection.
7. Overpayment / Refund traps.
8. Identity theft (demanding SSN, passport, bank login upfront).
9. Suspicious phishing links, fake domain spoofs, or suspicious download packages (.exe, .scr files).
10. Unfair contract terms (e.g., perpetual unlimited revision without pay, non-competes, extreme indemnification).

You MUST evaluate objectively, assign an accurate Risk Score (0 = Completely Legitimate, 100 = Definitive Scam), provide categorized red flags and green flags, outline actionable recommended safety steps, and draft a polite, boundary-setting reply the freelancer can copy-paste to stay safe.
```

### JSON Schema Enforcement Details
The server enforces a structured schema requiring:
* `titleSnippet`: Short summary title.
* `riskScore`: Integer between 0 and 100.
* `riskLevel`: Risk classification label.
* `scamType`: Identified fraud pattern category.
* `summary`: 2–3 sentence executive verdict.
* `redFlags`: Array of `{ title, description, severity, category }`.
* `greenFlags`: Array of `{ title, description }`.
* `contractConcerns`: Array of risky clause descriptions.
* `recommendedActions`: Actionable steps.
* `suggestedReply`: Defensive, polite response message template.
* `safeQuestionsToAsk`: Array of probing questions.
